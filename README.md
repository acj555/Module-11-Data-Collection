# Module-11-Data-Collection

Project Overview
This project involves web scraping and analyzing Martian weather data. Using Splinter and BeautifulSoup, we extracted temperature and atmospheric pressure data from a webpage, stored it in a structured format, performed data analysis, and saved the results to a CSV file.
